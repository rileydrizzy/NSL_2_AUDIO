<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

***Overview:*** \
This project is dedicated to the development of an Automatic Sign Language Translation system, with a specific focus on translating Nigerian Sign Language (NSL) into one of the Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) spoken in Nigeria. The primary objective is to address the communication challenges faced by the NSL community and contribute to inclusivity and employment opportunities in education and the workforce.

***Significance:*** \
Effective communication is a cornerstone of societal cohesion, and this project addresses a critical gap in the integration of the NSL community into the broader society. Sign language, while vital for the hearing-impaired, often faces limitations in bridging the gap with the larger community. This project seeks to overcome these limitations and promote a more inclusive and understanding society.

***Potential Applications:***

- ***Education***:
  - Integration into schools and educational institutions to support hearing-impaired students.
  - Facilitation of communication in educational settings, creating a more inclusive learning environment.
- ***Workforce:***
  - Facilitating communication in the workplace, creating job opportunities for NSL speakers.
  - Promotion of diversity and inclusion in professional environments.
- ***Community Involvement:***
  - Empowering NSL speakers to engage more actively in community activities.
  - Bridging the gap between the NSL community and the broader society.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project is structured into three distinct parts, each housed in separate directories as outlined in the project proposal. The initial phase involves translating sign language into English text, followed by the second phase, which focuses on translating the English text into Yoruba text. The final segment entails taking the translated Yoruba text and converting it into generated Yoruba audio.

The `signa2text` directory is dedicated to the process of translating sign language into English text. Meanwhile, the `linguify_yb` directory serves the purpose of transforming English text into Yoruba text. Finally, the `yb2audio` directory is designated for utilizing the translated audio to generate Yoruba audio.

In `app` directory

To access any of the directories, navigate into the respective directory and adhere to the specified prerequisites in the respective directory README.
